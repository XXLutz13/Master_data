-> finish report + ask how he should grade it

- Most likely dummy grade wafer (relatively bad quality)  
    -> most likely n+ doped (due to the Phi_B differnce)  
    => calculate doping from V_bi  
    => calculate at what doping w_SCR is < 5 nm => get how many C-atoms are required  
     
- Si-side is a Zener-diode (can be seen by the backwards direction)  
     
- Maybe metal is irrelevant due to pinning -> only the interface is relevant  
     
- Evaporated Ge is amorphous => higher bandgap + dangling bonds get filled
- Fermi level pinning (trapping/detrapping) => C-side hase pinning  
    -> Si-side not pinned (V_bi is about equal to the difference in bandgaps)
- Temperature variation to see if tunneling
- C can have both Sp3 and Sp2 bonds  
    => Hybridisation can change the surface states/energies
- C easily gives off its 4. valence electron (to Ge / GeNi)  
    => Interface is effectively n+ doped  
    (surface energy is always minimized)  
    => Epitaxy is easier on the Si-side 

- If I use a different metal with a lower fermi level the C-side should become diodic again (V_bi should be the difference in fermi levels)

=> try using CVD to deposit a layer of C onto the Si-side to modify the interface properties  
(1/3 monolayer most likely -> get the number of C atoms in one layer compared to Si atoms)  
=> analize the C-side with temperature variation, surface energy, different metal to prove the pinning   
=> modify the Si-side
