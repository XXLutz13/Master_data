- 355 nm (1065 nm) Nd:YV4  Neodymium-doped yttrium orthovanadate
- 80 µm spot diameter -> now closer 60 µm due to a device error  
    gaussian beam profile -> Carsten states top-hat see image!  
    => overlapping can't be guaranteed at the moment !!!
- For my experiments about 10 - 20 different irradiation parameters should be possible on a single wafer  
    -> define areas and ignore border regions between parameters
- For my irradiation studies first 0 overlapping could be used in order to avoid the spot size problem  
    -> BUT: make a simple concept of how to overlap correctly using the setup in Erlangen to get the desired PPP values

- Irradiation the substrate above some threshold fluence (value unknown) changes the polytype from 4H to 3C

- In Michaels experiments ohmic behaviour starting at 1,9 J/cm^2 (R_sh < 0,5 Ohm*cm)
- Fluences up to 2,4 J/cm^2 where possible using the Al mirror process
- Starting at around 2,0 J/cm^2 the TLM contacts disperse => no valid TLM plot due to inconsistantly spaced or short circuited contacts
