The actual barrier height φB is less than φB0 due to image force barrier lowering and other factors.

Merits and limitations of circular TLM structures for contact resistance determination for novel III-V HBTs ([10.1109/ICMTS.2004.1309489]())

resistance R between the contacts: $R=\frac{R_{sh}}{2\pi(R_1)}[s+2L_T]\cdot c$
correction factor is described by: $c=\frac{R_1}{s}ln\frac{[R_1+s]}{R_1}$

the specific contact resistance can be calculated: $\rho_c=R_{sh,c}L_T \quad  [\Omega cm^2]$

-> The inner radius should be at least a few times the transfer length in order to have a reliable measurement result.
