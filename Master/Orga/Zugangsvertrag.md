topic description:  
1.0

This thesis focuses on adapting and optimizing a novel fabrication process for backside Ohmic contacts on Silicon Carbide (SiC) devices, utilizing the manufacturing capabilities at the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Systems and Device Technology (IISB) and the Chair of Electron Devices. The proposed method addresses a possible failure mechanism in conventional NiAl contacts on SiC where the formation of nickel silicides consumes silicon from the SiC substrate, leaving a carbon-rich interfacial layer that compromises mechanical stability.

The approach, previously investigated by the candidate in his research internship at the University of Viro (under the supervision of Dr. Stefano Chiussi), introduces an additional Germanium (Ge) interlayer between the SiC and the traditional Nickel (Ni) metallization, followed by laser annealing. By preventing direct contact between Ni and SiC, the Ge interlayer is expected to enable the formation of a mechanically robust and electrically efficient ohmic contact, eliminating the issue of carbon residue.

2.0 Nickel silicon contacts through Rapid Thermal Annealing for 4H-SiC

This thesis focuses on adapting and optimizing a novel fabrication process for ohmic contacts on Silicon Carbide (SiC) power devices, leveraging the advanced manufacturing capabilities at the Fraunhofer Institute and the Chair of Electron Devices.

The proposed method addresses a critical failure mechanism observed in conventional Ni/Al contacts on SiC. Specifically, the formation of nickel silicides consumes silicon from the SiC substrate, leaving a carbon-rich interfacial layer that compromises the mechanical stability of the contact.

To mitigate these unfavourable side effects, the novel approach utilizes additional Si interlayers. This strategy is designed to promote the formation of nickel silicides predominately by the added Si and Ni layers, thereby preserving the SiC substrate's integrity.

The contacts will be formed using Rapid Thermal Annealing (RTA). Since ohmic contact formation heavily relies on complex interface interactions, the fabrication and characterization will be performed on both n-type and p-type SiC substrates. Initial results will be compared against the currently used method and against contacts fabricated with other material compositions, which will be tested shortly.
