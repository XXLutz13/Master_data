simple cTLM process requiring significantly less steps than conventional TLM structures
-> use standard RTP process currently employed (980 °C for 2 min in Ar ?)


- Use cTLM process to quickly make samples
	- litho (Keff)
	- metal stack deposition (Sven)
	- lift-off (Sven)
	- RTP
	- cTLM measurement


Compare results from standard TLM specific resistance values to cTLM measurements 
-> watch out for inconsistencies regarding inline measurement or with contact metal 

=> validate cTLM process



determine material properties after annealing
  - XRD (get phase of Silicide)
  - Raman ?
  - SEM ?
  - FIBS 

=> analogue to [[NiSi]] cTLM


### Pure Ni?
as of know always sputtering of 2,5 volume % Al in the Ni
-> is a necessary constraint by the sputtering machine
=> potential experiment to sputter pure Ni (possible by the manufacturer) and see if this has an influence on the contact properties
