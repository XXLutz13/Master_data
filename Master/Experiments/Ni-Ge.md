### recreate material system from vigo
- cTLM structure analogue to [[Ni cTLM]], [[NiSi]]
- Ge sputtering https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288713900_Sputtered_germaniumsilicon_devices_for_photonics_applications


Ge for improving the contact resistance in n- and p-type ohmic contacts using implantation of Ge:
A technique to reduce the contact resistance to 4H-silicon carbide using germanium implantation ([10.1007/s11664-002-0080-0]()) 

-> possibility to ask Infineon for Wafers with different Ge thicknesses (2-3 Wafer)
-> or ask machine manufacturer
