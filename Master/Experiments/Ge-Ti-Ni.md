### Idea:
- use a Ge interlayer to create a heterojunction from the 4H-SiC substrate to Ge to effectively create a 2-step barrier
- Use Ti to form $Ti_2 SiC_3$ for p-type contacts (potentially Ge/Ti compounds)
  -> Ti acts as a diffusion barrier to enable the formation of an interlayer
- Use Ni to form germanides / silicides for n-type contacts 

=> very complex material systems with multiple partners

=> $Ti_2 SiC_3$ formation helps with p-type contact, but does not necessarily hinder n-type formation


### Questions:
- [ ] NiGe  -> problematic thermal stability?
- [ ] competing processes in the contact formation
- [ ] how tick do my layers need to be?
- [ ] can the Ni diffuse through the Ti layer sufficiently enough to create good contacts to n-type
- [ ] can the Ge interlayer reduce the barrier height far enough to enable the formation of p-type contacts 
- [ ] Annealing temperature unknown -> since Ge is far lower melting than Si potentially lower ?
	- > 750 °C required for Ni/SiC reaction (> 900 °C could potentially be harmful for Ge interlayer)
  -> what is known from the Ti/Al/Ni system (see Thesis Michael)

the ternary alloy Ti3SiC2 which divides the high barrier of metal/SiC contact interface into two low barriers may be correlated with ρc lowering.
